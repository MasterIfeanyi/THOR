# Writing Markdown for Open Source: A Practical Guide

So you want to contribute to open source projects, but you're staring at that Pull Request description box wondering how to make your changes look professional? Let me teach you Markdown—the simple formatting language that'll make your PRs shine.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you format text using simple symbols. It's everywhere in open source: README files, documentation, issue reports, and especially PR descriptions. The beauty? You can write it in plain text, and it renders beautifully on GitHub, GitLab, and most platforms.

## The Basics You'll Use Every Day

### Headers

Headers organize your content. Use the hash symbol `#` followed by a space:

```markdown
# This is an H1 (Main Title)
## This is an H2 (Section)
### This is an H3 (Subsection)
#### This is an H4
```

<Callout type="info">
**PR Tip:** Start your PR description with an H2 or H3 for "What Changed" or "Summary"—don't use H1 since the PR title is already your main header.
</Callout>

### Links

Links connect your PR to related issues, documentation, or external resources. The syntax is:

```markdown
[Link Text](URL)
```

Examples you'll actually use:

```markdown
Fixes [#123](https://github.com/project/repo/issues/123)
See [documentation](https://docs.example.com/api)
Related to [this discussion](https://github.com/project/repo/discussions/456)
```

<Callout type="info">
**Pro tip:** GitHub auto-links issue numbers, so `Fixes #123` works too, but the full link syntax is more explicit.
</Callout>

### Emphasis (Bold and Italic)

Make important points stand out:

```markdown
*This is italic* or _this is also italic_
**This is bold** or __this is also bold__
***This is bold and italic***
```

In PRs, use bold for things like **Breaking Change** or **Important** to catch reviewers' attention.

### Lists

Lists keep your changes organized and scannable.

**Unordered lists** use `-`, `*`, or `+`:

```markdown
- Fixed authentication bug
- Updated dependencies
- Improved error messages
  - Added context to validation errors
  - Clarified timeout messages
```

**Ordered lists** use numbers:

```markdown
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the tests
4. Submit your PR
```

### Code

Code formatting is crucial for technical PRs.

**Inline code** uses backticks:

```markdown
The `getUserData()` function now handles `null` values correctly.
```

**Code blocks** use triple backticks with an optional language:

````markdown
```javascript
function getUserData(id) {
  if (!id) return null;
  return database.query(id);
}
```
````

<Callout type="warning">
**In PRs:** Always specify the language (`javascript`, `python`, `bash`, etc.) for syntax highlighting.
</Callout>

## Essential Markdown for PR Descriptions

Here's a realistic PR description structure:

```markdown
## Summary

Fixes #247 - Users were unable to log in with special characters in passwords.

## Changes Made

- Updated password validation regex in `auth/validator.js`
- Added URL encoding for password transmission
- Implemented additional test cases for edge cases

## Testing

Tested with passwords containing: `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, and Unicode characters.

**Before:** Login failed with special characters
**After:** All character types now work correctly

## Breaking Changes

None

## Screenshots (if applicable)

```

### Other Useful Elements

**Blockquotes** for highlighting important notes:

```markdown
> **Note:** This change requires Node.js version 18 or higher.
```

**Horizontal rules** to separate sections:

```markdown
---
```

**Tables** for comparisons or data:

```markdown
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Slow query | Optimized query |
| 2.3s | 0.4s |
```

**Task lists** for tracking work:

```markdown
- [x] Write tests
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Get review from @maintainer
```

## GitHub-Specific Features

GitHub extends standard Markdown with helpful features:

**Mentioning users:** `@username` notifies them

**Referencing issues/PRs:** `#123` links to issue 123

**Emoji:** `:tada:` becomes 🎉 (use sparingly!)

**Collapsible sections:**

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to expand full error log</summary>

```
Error: Connection timeout
  at Database.connect (db.js:45)
```

</details>
```

## A Complete PR Description Template

Here's everything together:

```markdown
## Summary

Fixes #156 - Implements user profile caching to improve page load times.

## Problem

Profile pages were making redundant API calls on every render, causing slow load times (avg 3.2s).

## Solution

- Added Redis caching layer for user profiles
- Implemented 5-minute cache TTL
- Added cache invalidation on profile updates

## Changes

- `src/services/userService.js` - Added caching logic
- `src/config/redis.js` - New Redis configuration
- `tests/userService.test.js` - Added cache tests

## Testing

- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration tests pass
- [x] Tested cache invalidation manually
- [x] Load tested with 1000 concurrent users

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Avg page load | 3.2s | 0.8s |
| API calls/render | 5 | 1 |

## Breaking Changes

None - changes are backward compatible

## Additional Notes

Cache can be disabled by setting `ENABLE_PROFILE_CACHE=false` in environment variables.

## Practice Makes Perfect

The best way to learn? Start writing:

1. Edit your GitHub profile README
2. Open a practice issue on your own repo
3. Write a detailed PR description for your next contribution
