## Routing Open Source  
*A practical, end-to-end guide for GSoC and Outreachy applicants*

<Callout type="info">
This guide assumes today is January 1st, 2025.  
You are serious, organized, and trying to avoid wandering blindly through open source.
</Callout>

Open source programs like **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and **Outreachy** are not random opportunities. They are structured pipelines.

If you treat them like pipelines, your odds improve dramatically.

This article tracks **two complete paths**, step by step.

## Route 1: Outreachy Path (Example Project: OmegaUp)

### Step 1: You Got Accepted. What Now?

You passed the eligibility and essay stage. Good.

Now Outreachy shifts from **identity** to **execution**.

Your next priority is:
> Becoming a visible, reliable contributor during the contribution period.

---

### Step 2: How Do You Pick a Project?

You do not pick randomly.

You evaluate projects using these criteria:
- Active maintainers
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Beginner-friendly issues
- Public communication channels

OmegaUp fits well because:
- It has structured tasks
- It welcomes first-time contributors
- It values documentation and frontend contributions

Project page will usually be linked from Outreachy’s dashboard.

---

### Step 3: How Do You Join the Community?

Most projects list communication channels in one of these places:
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Outreachy project description

Typical channels:
- Slack
- Discord
- Zulip
- Mailing lists
- GitHub Discussions

<Callout type="success">
Join the chat immediately. Even before your first contribution.
</Callout>

When you join:
- Introduce yourself briefly
- Mention you are an Outreachy applicant
- Ask where contributors coordinate tasks

---

### Step 4: Where Do You Find Tasks?

Tasks usually live in:
- GitHub Issues
- GitLab Issues
- Project task trackers linked from Outreachy

Look for labels like:
- `good first issue`
- `beginner`
- `help wanted`
- `Outreachy`

You do not wait for tasks to be assigned.

You pick one and comment:
> “I would like to work on this issue. Is it okay if I start?”

---

### Step 5: Do You Set Up the Codebase Locally?

Yes. Always.

Even documentation changes benefit from local setup.

Typical steps:
- Fork the repository
- Clone it locally
- Follow setup instructions exactly
- Run the project
- Fix setup issues and document them if unclear

<Callout type="info">
Maintainers notice contributors who improve setup docs without being asked.
</Callout>

---

### Step 6: Who Assigns Work to You?

Usually:
- No one assigns tasks formally
- Maintainers guide and review
- You self-select tasks

Your responsibility is momentum.

---

### Step 7: How Do You Get Noticed During Outreachy?

You get noticed by:
- Finishing tasks you start
- Communicating progress publicly
- Responding to feedback quickly
- Helping others who are stuck
- Writing clear pull request descriptions

Not by:
- Big claims
- Overpromising
- Silent grinding

---

## Route 2: GSoC Path (Example Organization: Wikimedia)

### Step 1: January to February. Preparation Phase

Before contributor applications open, you should:
- Review past Wikimedia GSoC projects
- Read proposal archives
- Explore their repositories
- Join community channels early

Wikimedia communication often happens on:
- Phabricator
- Mailing lists
- IRC or Matrix
- Git repositories on Gerrit or GitHub

---

### Step 2: Organization Acceptance Announcement

Once Wikimedia is accepted as a GSoC organization:
- Project ideas are published
- Mentors are listed
- Contact channels are made explicit

This is when your work becomes visible.

---

### Step 3: How Do You Pick a Wikimedia Project?

Strong selection criteria:
- Clear project scope
- Active mentor responses
- Technology you can reasonably learn
- Existing documentation

Avoid projects that:
- Are vaguely defined
- Have unresponsive mentors
- Require deep domain knowledge with no onboarding

---

### Step 4: Community Bonding Before Proposal Submission

This is where many applicants fail.

Before submitting your proposal:
- Introduce yourself to mentors
- Ask clarifying questions
- Fix at least one small issue
- Show you can navigate their tooling

<Callout type="warning">
Submitting a proposal without prior interaction drastically lowers your chances.
</Callout>

---

### Step 5: Proposal Writing

A strong GSoC proposal includes:
- Clear problem definition
- Realistic milestones
- Understanding of the codebase
- A learning plan
- A fallback plan

It is not a motivational essay.

It is a technical plan written for engineers.

---

### Step 6: After Acceptance. What Happens?

If selected:
- You enter community bonding
- You refine your timeline with mentors
- You finalize deliverables
- You begin structured development

You are expected to:
- Communicate weekly
- Track progress publicly
- Adjust scope when needed
- Ask questions early

---

### Step 7: How Do You Stay Valuable During GSoC?

You stay valuable by:
- Writing tests
- Improving documentation
- Reviewing related changes
- Helping other contributors
- Leaving the project better than you found it

GSoC success is measured by **impact**, not lines of code.

---

## Shared Rules for Both Paths

<Callout type="info">
GSoC and Outreachy reward the same behaviors.
</Callout>

These matter everywhere:
- Consistency over brilliance
- Communication over isolation
- Follow-through over ambition
- Respect for maintainers’ time

You are not trying to impress.
You are trying to collaborate.

---

## Final Perspective

Open source programs are not gates you magically pass.

They are **paths you walk deliberately**.

If you:
- Start early
- Choose projects wisely
- Show up consistently
- Learn in public

You stop being “an applicant” and start being “a contributor”.

That is the real routing.
