# Welcome to Open Source

If you have ever looked at an open-source repository and thought:

> “This looks cool, but I have no idea where to start”

This documentation is for you.

You do not need to be an expert.
You do not need to know everything.
You only need curiosity and the courage to try.

## What is open source?

Open source means the code is public.

Anyone can:
- Read it
- Use it
- Improve it
- Fix mistakes

Most of the software you use every day exists because strangers helped strangers on the internet.
