# Your First Pull Request: A Step-by-Step Guide

So you've found a bug to fix or a feature to add, and you're ready to contribute. But how do you actually get your code from your computer into someone else's project? Let me walk you through creating your very first Pull Request (PR).

## Before You Start: Understanding the Workflow

A Pull Request is your way of saying: "Hey, I made some improvements to your code—want to merge them in?" It's called a "pull request" because you're asking the maintainers to *pull* your changes into their project.

The basic flow looks like this:

1. Get a copy of the code
2. Make your changes in a separate branch
3. Push your changes
4. Open a PR
5. Respond to feedback
6. Celebrate when it's merged! 🎉

## Step 1: Getting the Code

The first step depends on whether you're working with a public or private repository.

### For Public Repositories (Most Open Source Projects)

**Fork the repository first.** A fork is your own copy of the project on GitHub.

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. GitHub creates a copy under your account (like `yourname/project-name`)

Then clone **your fork** to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

<Callout type="info">
**Why fork?** You don't have permission to push directly to someone else's repository. Your fork is yours—you can do whatever you want there.
</Callout>

### For Private Repositories (Your Team/Company Projects)

**Just clone directly** since you already have access:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/company/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you have the right permissions! If you can't clone, ask your team lead for access.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Remote (For Forked Repos Only)

If you forked the repo, add the original repository as a remote called "upstream". This lets you sync with the latest changes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project-name.git
```

Verify your remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git (your fork)
# upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/project-name.git (original)
```

## Step 3: Create a Branch

<Callout type="error">
**Never work directly on `main` or `master`!** Always create a separate branch for your changes.
</Callout>

```bash
git checkout -b feature/landing-page
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

Good branch names are descriptive and follow project conventions:

```bash
# Features
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode

# Bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/login-button-alignment
git checkout -b bugfix/null-pointer-exception

# Documentation
git checkout -b docs/api-documentation
git checkout -b docs/update-readme

# Refactoring
git checkout -b refactor/database-queries
```

<Callout type="info">
**Pro Tip:** Check if the project has a CONTRIBUTING.md file—it often specifies their branch naming format!
</Callout>

Some projects use issue numbers:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/issue-247-password-validation
git checkout -b 247-password-validation
```

## Step 4: Make Your Changes

Now do your actual work—write code, fix bugs, update documentation. Here's where the magic happens!

### Before You Commit: A Checklist

- [ ] **Does your code work?** Test it locally
- [ ] **Does it follow the project's style?** Check for linters or formatting tools
- [ ] **Did you write/update tests?** Most projects require tests
- [ ] **Did you update documentation?** If you changed behavior, update the docs
- [ ] **Did you test edge cases?** Don't just test the happy path

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
# Or add specific files
git add src/components/LandingPage.jsx
git add README.md
```

Commit with a clear message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add responsive landing page with hero section"
```

### Writing Good Commit Messages

Your commit message should explain **what** and **why**, not *how* (the code shows how).

**Bad commit messages:**

<Callout type="error">
```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "changes to landing page"
```
</Callout>

**Good commit messages:**

<Callout type="success">
```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile navigation menu overflow on small screens"
git commit -m "feat: add password strength indicator to signup form"
git commit -m "docs: update API authentication examples in README"
```
</Callout>

Many projects use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

<Callout type="info">
**Multiple Commits?** That's fine! Each commit should represent one logical change. You can always squash them later if the project requires it.
</Callout>

## Step 6: Push Your Branch

### For Forked Repositories

Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/landing-page
```

### For Direct Access (Private Repos)

Same command:

```bash
git push origin feature/landing-page
```

If this is your first push of this branch, Git might suggest setting the upstream:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature/landing-page
```

## Step 7: Create the Pull Request

Now comes the exciting part!

1. Go to GitHub and navigate to the **original repository** (not your fork)
2. You'll usually see a yellow banner saying "Compare & pull request"—click it!
3. Or click "Pull requests" tab → "New pull request" → choose your branch

### Filling Out Your PR

Your PR has two main parts: **title** and **description**.

**Title:** Clear and concise, like a newspaper headline

<Callout type="success">
**Good PR Titles:**
- Add responsive landing page with hero section
- Fix authentication timeout on slow connections
- Update installation instructions in README
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
**Bad PR Titles:**
- Updates
- Changes to code
- Fixed the thing
</Callout>

**Description:** Tell the whole story. Here's a template:

```markdown
## Summary

Fixes #156 - Adds a new landing page with responsive hero section and feature highlights.

## What Changed

- Created new `LandingPage.jsx` component
- Added responsive CSS Grid layout
- Implemented mobile-friendly navigation
- Added hero section with CTA button

## Why These Changes

The current homepage doesn't clearly communicate our product value to new visitors. This redesign:
- Improves first impression with clear value proposition
- Increases mobile usability (65% of our traffic)
- Follows our new brand guidelines

## Screenshots

### Desktop View

## Testing

- [x] Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [x] Tested on mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- [x] Verified accessibility with screen reader
- [x] All existing tests pass

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Added/updated tests
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Tested locally

## Additional Notes

The hero image is placeholder—waiting on design team for final asset.
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Link related issues! Use keywords like `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, or `Resolves #123` to auto-close issues when your PR merges.
</Callout>

## Step 8: The Review Process

Once your PR is open, maintainers will review it. Here's what to expect:

### You Might Get Feedback

Don't panic! Code review is normal and healthy. Common feedback includes:

- "Can you add tests for this?"
- "This breaks our coding style, can you run the formatter?"
- "Great work! Just one small change needed..."

### Responding to Feedback

**Be professional and gracious:**

<Callout type="success">
**Good Responses:**
- "Good catch! I've added tests and pushed a new commit."
- "Thanks for the feedback! I've refactored it as suggested."
- "You're right, I missed that edge case. Fixed in the latest commit."
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
**Bad Responses:**
- "But my way is better..."
- "You don't understand what I'm trying to do"
- (No response at all)
</Callout>

### Making Changes After Feedback

Just commit and push to the same branch:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for LandingPage component"
git push origin feature/landing-page
```

The PR automatically updates with your new commits!

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Working on `main` Instead of a Branch

**Problem:** You made changes directly on `main` and now can't create a clean PR.

**Solution:** Create a branch from your current state:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-changes
git push origin feature/my-changes
```

Then reset your `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### ❌ Your Branch is Behind `main`

**Problem:** The main branch got updates while you were working, and now there are conflicts.

**Solution:** Sync your branch:

```bash
# If you forked the repo
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout feature/landing-page
git merge main

# Or use rebase (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/landing-page
git rebase main
```

<Callout type="info">
**Merge vs Rebase?** For your first PRs, use `merge`. It's safer. Learn `rebase` later when you're comfortable.
</Callout>

### ❌ Too Many Unrelated Changes in One PR

**Problem:** Your PR changes 10 different things, making it hard to review.

**Solution:** Keep PRs focused on one thing. If you have multiple improvements, create multiple PRs.

<Callout type="success">
**Good Approach:**
- One PR: "Add dark mode toggle"
- Another PR: "Fix login validation"
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
**Bad Approach:**
- One PR: "Add dark mode, fix login, update footer, refactor API calls, add tests"
</Callout>

### ❌ Massive PRs with Thousands of Lines Changed

**Problem:** Your PR is 3,000 lines and reviewers don't know where to start.

**Solution:** Break it into smaller PRs. Big features can be built incrementally:

1. PR #1: Add basic structure (200 lines)
2. PR #2: Add core functionality (300 lines)
3. PR #3: Add styling and polish (250 lines)

<Callout type="info">
**Rule of Thumb:** Aim for PRs under 400 lines of changes. Reviewers are much more likely to review smaller PRs quickly.
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Great PRs

### ✅ Do

- **Read the CONTRIBUTING.md file first** - Most projects have contribution guidelines
- **Start small** - Fix a typo, improve documentation, tackle a "good first issue"
- **Ask questions** - Comment on the issue before starting if you're unsure
- **Test thoroughly** - Don't let reviewers find basic bugs
- **Be patient** - Maintainers are often volunteers with day jobs
- **Follow up** - If you haven't heard back in a week, politely ping the PR
- **Say thank you** - Appreciate the reviewers' time

### ❌ Don't

- **Submit untested code** - Always test locally first
- **Ignore CI failures** - If automated tests fail, fix them
- **Take feedback personally** - Code review isn't about you, it's about the code
- **Ghost your PR** - If you can't finish it, say so
- **Demand immediate review** - Maintainers have their own schedules
- **Rewrite entire projects** - Start small, earn trust, then tackle bigger things

## After Your PR is Merged

Congratulations! 🎉 You're now an open source contributor!

**Clean up your local branches:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main  # or just 'git pull' for private repos
git branch -d feature/landing-page  # delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/landing-page  # delete remote branch
```

**Update your fork's main branch** (if you forked):

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

Now you're ready for your next contribution!

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Initial setup (forked repo)
