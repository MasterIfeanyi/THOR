## A Practical MLH Fellowship Guide  


### Following Jake, 23 | January 1st, 2025

<Callout type="info">
This guide follows a fictional applicant named Jake, age 23, starting on January 1st, 2025, as he prepares to apply for the MLH Fellowship.
</Callout>

Jake:
- Is 23 years old
- Knows the MERN stack
- Has no major physical or financial hardships
- Has never applied to MLH before
- Wants a realistic plan, not hype

This is an end-to-end guide, from planning to potential acceptance.


## What Is MLH Fellowship, Really

The MLH Fellowship is a **remote, paid, cohort-based program** where you:
- Collaborate with other developers
- Work on open source or MLH partner projects
- Learn industry workflows
- Build public, reviewable work

It is competitive, but not mysterious.

## Step 1: Understanding the Application Windows (2025)

As of recent cycles, MLH Fellowships typically run **multiple cohorts per year**.

Common pattern:
- **Spring Fellowship**
- **Summer Fellowship**
- **Fall Fellowship**

Typical timing looks like this:

<Callout type="warning">
Exact dates change every year. Always verify on the official MLH Fellowship site.
</Callout>

### Likely 2025 Timeline (Approximate)

- **January to February**  
  Applications open for Spring and Summer cohorts

- **March to April**  
  Interviews and selections for Spring

- **May to June**  
  Interviews and selections for Summer

- **September**  
  Fall Fellowship applications open

Jake's first action on **January 1st, 2025** is simple:
- Bookmark the MLH Fellowship site
- Subscribe to email updates
- Follow MLH on Twitter and LinkedIn



## Step 2: Setting Up a Reminder System That Actually Works

<Callout type="success">
Strong applicants do not rely on memory. They rely on systems.
</Callout>

Jake sets up:
- Google Calendar reminders
- One Notion page called “MLH Fellowship 2025”
- A checklist with deadlines and links

### Recommended Reminder Setup

- Calendar reminder 2 weeks before application deadlines
- Calendar reminder 3 days before deadlines
- Monthly reminder to check the MLH site for date changes

Dates shift. Programs evolve. Missing updates is a common reason people miss cycles.



## Step 3: Deciding What to Build (January to March)

Jake knows MERN. That is fine.

MLH is not testing how many languages you know.  
They are testing how you **build, collaborate, and explain decisions**.



### What Kind of Project Jake Should Build

Jake chooses **one solid, opinionated project**, not many small ones.

Good project traits:
- Solves a real problem
- Has users, even if small
- Is deployed
- Has a clean README
- Shows iteration over time

Example project ideas:
- Developer tool for tracking pull requests
- Study group platform with real users
- Open source contribution dashboard
- API-first application with documentation

<Callout type="info">
One well-documented project beats five unfinished demos.
</Callout>



### Project Timeline

**January**
- Decide project idea
- Write a short project plan
- Set up repository and README

**February**
- Build core features
- Deploy early
- Fix bugs in public

**March**
- Polish documentation
- Add tests if possible
- Write a clear “What I Learned” section



## Step 4: Who Jake Should Talk To (And Why)

MLH applications ask reflective questions.  
Jake does not need trauma. He needs **clarity**.

People Jake should talk to:
- Friends who have applied to programs
- Former hackathon teammates
- Family members who understand his work ethic
- Mentors or seniors in tech

Questions Jake asks them:
- What strengths do you see in me?
- Where do I struggle?
- What kind of teams do I work best in?

These answers help him write honest essays.


## Step 5: Writing the Essays (Without a Hardship Narrative)

<Callout type="warning">
MLH does not require suffering stories. Forced narratives are obvious and hurt applications.
</Callout>

Jake does not have major financial or physical barriers. That is okay.

His essays focus on:
- Growth
- Curiosity
- Collaboration
- Learning in public
- Consistency



### Types of Essays Jake Writes

#### Personal Motivation Essay
- Why he enjoys building
- What excites him about collaborative learning
- What he wants to improve

#### Teamwork Essay
- A time he worked in a group
- A conflict or disagreement
- How it was resolved

#### Learning Essay
- A hard technical concept he struggled with
- How he figured it out
- What changed in his approach afterward

<Callout type="success">
MLH values reflection more than perfection.
</Callout>



## Step 6: Should Jake Learn a New Language

Short answer: **no, not urgently**.

Long answer:  
Jake should deepen his fundamentals before chasing novelty.

What matters more than a new language:
- Clean Git history
- Readable code
- Tests
- Clear documentation
- Comfort with code reviews

Optional expansions if time allows:
- TypeScript mastery
- Basic Python for scripting
- Familiarity with Docker
- Reading other people's code

<Callout type="info">
Depth beats breadth for MLH.
</Callout>



## Step 7: Applying and Interview Phase

Jake submits early.

He double-checks:
- Links work
- GitHub is public
- README explains his thinking
- Essays answer the actual questions

If invited to interview:
- He prepares examples
- He speaks honestly
- He asks questions about mentorship and expectations



## Step 8: After Submission (The Part People Ignore)

Jake does not stop building.

Even after applying:
- He continues improving his project
- He contributes small fixes to open source
- He documents learning publicly

If accepted, this momentum helps immediately.  
If rejected, he is already stronger for the next cycle.



## Final Reality Check

<Callout type="info">
The MLH Fellowship rewards people who show up consistently, communicate clearly, and build in public.
</Callout>

Jake does not try to impress.  
He tries to be **reliable, curious, and thoughtful**.

That is what gets people in.

## Closing Thought

This process is not about luck.

It is about preparation, honesty, and follow-through.

If you can build steadily, reflect clearly, and collaborate respectfully, you are already aligned with what MLH looks for.
