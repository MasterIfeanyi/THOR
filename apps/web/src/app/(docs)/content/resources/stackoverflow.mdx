## How to Find Help Without Burning Bridges

Knowing how to search and ask for help is a core engineering skill. In open source and programs like Outreachy, mentors pay close attention to how you unblock yourself.

This section covers three essential skills:
- Asking effective questions on Stack Overflow
- Using Google dorking to find high-signal answers
- Finding high-quality technical writing instead of content noise



## 1. How to Use Stack Overflow Without Getting Downvoted

<Callout type="info">
Stack Overflow is designed for precise, reproducible technical questions. It is not a general learning forum or a place for open-ended discussions.
</Callout>

Many people think Stack Overflow is hostile. It is not. It is structured.  
Most downvotes happen because questions break implicit rules, not because the problem is bad.



### What Stack Overflow Is For

Stack Overflow works best when the question:
- Describes a specific problem
- Can be reproduced by someone else
- Has a clear expected outcome
- Focuses on one issue only

<Callout type="warning">
Questions that are vague, opinion-based, or framed as tutorials are often closed quickly.
</Callout>



### Before You Ask Anything

Before posting, answer these questions honestly:

- Can someone reproduce this issue using only my question?
- Have I clearly shown what I already tried?
- Am I asking one focused question, not several?

If the answer to any of these is no, revise before posting.



### The Structure of a High-Quality Stack Overflow Question

#### 1. Write a Precise Title

<Callout type="error">
**Bad title:**  
React error help please
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
**Good title:**  
React useEffect runs twice in development with StrictMode enabled
</Callout>

Titles should describe the technical issue, not your frustration.



#### 2. Give Brief Context

One or two sentences is enough.

Example:

```text
I am building a React 18 application and noticed that an API call inside useEffect runs twice in development mode but not in production.
```

Avoid background stories or unrelated details.



#### 3. Provide a Minimal Reproducible Example

This is the most important part.

* Remove unrelated code
* Keep only what triggers the problem
* Use fenced code blocks
* Share a sandbox or gist if possible

Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData()
}, [])
```



#### 4. State Expected vs Actual Behavior

Never assume the reader will infer this.

```text
Expected: fetchData runs once on component mount  
Actual: fetchData runs twice in development mode
```



#### 5. Explain What You Already Tried

<Callout type="info">
This section prevents downvotes. It shows respect for the reader's time.
</Callout>

Example:

```text
I disabled StrictMode and confirmed the issue disappears. I also checked the React documentation but I am unsure whether this behavior is intentional or a misuse on my part.
```



### How to Phrase Questions That Get Respect

Avoid phrases like:

* “I am new”
* “Please help urgently”
* “Why is this not working”

Prefer phrasing like:

* “I might be misunderstanding X”
* “According to the documentation, X should do Y, but I am seeing Z”
* “Is this expected behavior or a misuse on my part?”

Clear language signals maturity.
