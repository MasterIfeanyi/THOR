## How to Find High-Quality Technical Writing

Not all articles teach the same thing.

Some teach syntax.
Others teach judgment.

You want writing that explains trade-offs, mental models, and reasoning.



### Kent C. Dodds

Kent writes deeply about:

* React mental models
* Testing philosophy
* Developer experience

Search like this:

```text
site:kentcdodds.com react testing
site:egghead.io kent c dodds
```

His writing explains why patterns exist, not just how to use them.



### phryneas (Redux Core Maintainer)

If you work with Redux or RTK, his explanations are essential.

Search:

```text
site:stackoverflow.com phryneas redux
site:github.com phryneas redux
```

Many of his Stack Overflow answers are better than long blog posts.



### DEV.to With Filtering

DEV.to has mixed quality. Filter aggressively.

```text
site:dev.to react performance
site:dev.to "deep dive" react
```

Check the author:

* Do they reference official documentation?
* Do they explain trade-offs?
* Do they link to source code?

If not, move on.



### Medium Without the Noise

Medium requires filtering to be useful.

```text
site:medium.com react architecture
site:medium.com "lessons learned" open source
```

Avoid articles with titles like:

* “X things you must know”
* “Ultimate guide”
* “Become senior in 30 days”

These are content farms, not engineering writing.



## Building a Personal Learning System

<Callout type="info">
Strong engineers do not memorize answers. They build systems for finding them.
</Callout>

A simple approach:

1. Check official documentation
2. Search GitHub issues
3. Use Stack Overflow for edge cases
4. Read long-form articles for deeper understanding
5. Save and revisit high-quality links

Mentors notice when your questions are informed by reading.



## The Hidden Skill Outreachy Is Testing

Outreachy is not testing:

* How much you already know
* How fast you can code

It is testing:

* How you learn
* How you search
* How you ask questions
* How you respect other people's time

Master these three skills and you will stand out anywhere in open source.

```


If you want, next I can:
- Extract reusable MDX components like `<GoodExample />` and `<BadExample />`
- Align this exactly with your existing blog theme
- Convert other sections of your Outreachy guide into clean MDX

Just tell me the next move.
```
