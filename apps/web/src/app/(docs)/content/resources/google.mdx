## How to Use Google Dorking to Find High-Quality Solutions

Most developers underuse Google.
Google dorking means telling Google exactly what you want and what to exclude.


### Core Operators You Should Know

#### `site:`

Search within a specific website.

```text
site:stackoverflow.com react useEffect strict mode
site:github.com issue "cannot read property"
site:reactjs.org useEffect StrictMode
```

This removes most noise immediately.



#### Quotation Marks

Use quotes for exact phrases.

```text
"useEffect runs twice" react
"StrictMode double render"
```

This is especially useful for error messages.



#### Exclusion Operator

Exclude irrelevant frameworks or platforms.

```text
react hydration error -nextjs -gatsby
```



#### `intitle:` and `inurl:`

Target deeper technical writing.

```text
intitle:"deep dive" react useEffect
inurl:blog react performance
```

Articles using phrases like “deep dive” are often written by experienced engineers.



### Combining Operators for High Signal

```text
site:github.com issue "useEffect runs twice" StrictMode
```

This finds GitHub discussions where maintainers explain design decisions.

GitHub issues often contain more accurate explanations than blog posts because they show maintainer intent.
